In this project, I completed tasks:

Load the data as a pandas data frame.

Clean the data, taking care of the blank entries.

Run exploratory data analysis and identify the attributes that most affect the charges.

Develop single variable and multivariable Linear Regression models for predicting the charges.

Use Ridge regression to refine the performance of Linear regression models.
